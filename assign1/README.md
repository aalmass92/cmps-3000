## Bug Reporting Workflow

This is a simple Python program for reporting bugs via the command line.

### How to Run

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder containing `assign1.py`.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python assign1.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter bug details.

Collect bug report details from the user, input including description, severity, reproducibility, attachment status, report frequency, and system impact.
Validate the bug report by checking its severity, reproducibility, and whether it has an attachment.
The main focus is on guiding the user through reporting a bug and validating the report based on user input.
